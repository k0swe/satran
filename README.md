# Open source Azimuth/Elevation satellite antenna rotator for radio amateurs

- Designed by Daniel Nikolajsen, SM7YSA

The onboard microprocessor has wifi-capability and can be controlled
automatically with an easy to use android app that you can install for free from
Google Play, or with the free PC program Gpredict or other rotctld-compatible
software.

The rotator has a mount on top that allows for many different kinds of antennas,
perfect for getting started with satellite communications.

The MK3 Satellite Rotator is fully open source, allowing you to 3D-print the
parts at home for free and solder the PCBs by hand. Enjoy!

If you invent upgrades or find new ways of using the SATRAN, we hope that you
[contact us](https://www.satran.io/support/) and share your designs so we can
post it here on the website for all to enjoy.
